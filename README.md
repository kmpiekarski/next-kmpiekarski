# Portfolio Website

Welcome to this ongoing portfolio project.

This project is built with:

- [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/learn/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Sanity](https://sanity.io)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)

The site is hosted in Netlify on the domain [kmpiekarski.netlify.app](https://kmpiekarski.netlify.app) and utilizes GitHub Actions for CI.

## Staring the App

To run this site on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) follow these steps

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

To run Sanity Studio locally on [localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)

```
npm run sanity-dev
```

To deploy Sanity schemas to Sanity Studio

```
npm run sanity-deploy
```

## Local .ENV file

You will need to create `env.local` in the root directory, where you will set your varables to access the Contentful workspace.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID="_________"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET="_________"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION="_________"
```

Secret keys to authorize its connection with Contentful are set in this GitHub repository as a _repository secret_ in GitHub. This is critical to ensure the CI build will not fail while _linting_. You will have to also [set these in Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/environment-variables/overview/) or whatever service intend to use.
